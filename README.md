Lexer example C# - Notepad++ plugin
===================================

In Notepad++ the Lexer and Folder functions are used to add syntax highlighting and folding options to a text file.
[Syntax highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting) means displaying words or text parts
in a different color so that it's easier to read, write and find errors.
[Folding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_folding) means grouping parts of text
and allowing the user to show or hide those parts using expand [+] or collapse [-] icons in the sidebar.

This is an example project that applies syntax highlighting and folding to EDIFACT data files.
It is meant to show how to setup a C# project with custom `Lex()` and `Fold()` methods.

The syntax highlighting colors and keywords are based on user configuration
in the [EdifactLexer.xml](/config/EdifactLexer.xml) file.
This is just an example code project, it's not meant to be a full EDIFACT editor.

Custom Lexer
------------
You can create a custom Lexer for new unsupported programming languages, data files or other structured text files.
This lexer example is for data files, but technically it is very similar compared to a Lexer for source files.

Syntax highlighting rules can be the same for all files,
like segment names in Edifact which can be set as keywords in [Settings > Style configurator](/config/EdifactLexer.xml).
For other types of files like character separated values, the separator character can be different per file
and the user has to somehow set it at run-time.

Template Project
----------------
The goal is to create a Lexer plugin project, as a starting point or template for programming new plug-ins.

It is meant for finding out how to set it up and apply it [my other plugin](https://github.com/BdR76/CSVLint).
Also see this [forum post](https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/topic/21124/c-adding-a-custom-styler-or-lexer-in-c-for-scintilla-notepad/6)

See screenshot below, the plugin works and this is what the current plug-in project can do

How to install
--------------
You can try the file `EdifactLexer.dll`. In your \Notepad++\plugins\ folder,
create a new folder `EdifactLexer` and place the .dll file there, so:

* copy the file [.\LexerPlugin\NppManagedPluginDemo\bin\Release\EdifactLexer.dll](/LexerPlugin/NppManagedPluginDemo/bin/Release/)
* to new folder .\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\plugins\EdifactLexer\EdifactLexer.dll

For the 64-bit version it is the same, except the output file is in the
[Release-x64](/LexerPlugin/NppManagedPluginDemo/bin/Release-x64/) folder and Notepad++ is
in the `.\Program Files\Notepad++\` folder.

Also copy the file [EdifactLexer.xml](./config/) to your `.\Program Files\Notepad++\plugins\Config\` folder, this file contains the settings for the  text styling.
